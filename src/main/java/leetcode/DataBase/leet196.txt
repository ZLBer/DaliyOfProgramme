# Write your MySQL query statement below

#delete a from Person a,Person b where a.Email=b.Email and a.Id >b.Id


delete from Person where id not in(select min(id) as id from Person group by email)
you will be noted " You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause ",
The solution is using a middle table with select clause:

delete from Person where id not in(
    select t.id from (
        select min(id) as id from Person group by email
    ) t
)
